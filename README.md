# 🚀 LeetCode Top 150 Challenge

Starting **1st January**, I am solving the **LeetCode Top 150 Interview Questions** to strengthen my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) fundamentals and improve problem‑solving consistency.

This repository documents my daily progress, solutions, and learnings throughout the journey.

---

## 📌 Goal

* Build strong problem-solving fundamentals
* Improve coding logic and optimization skills
* Prepare for **technical interviews & placements**
* Maintain discipline through daily practice

---

## 🗓️ Challenge Details

* **Start Date:** 1 January
* **Target:** Complete all 150 curated LeetCode problems
* **Language Used:** Java (primary)
* **Approach:** Clean, readable, and optimized solutions

Each folder contains:

* ✅ Problem solution code
* 🧠 Optimized approach
* ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
* ✍️ Clean and readable implementation

---

## 🧠 Learning Strategy

* Solve problems topic-wise
* Start with brute-force → optimize
* Focus on patterns (sliding window, two pointers, recursion, etc.)
* Revise mistakes and edge cases
* Maintain consistency over speed

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

I am solving problems daily and updating this repository regularly.

✔ Day-wise consistency
✔ Interview-focused problems
✔ Quality over quantity

---

## 🏆 Motivation

> "This is not just a 150-question challenge — it's a habit-building journey toward becoming a better problem solver in 2026."

Every bug teaches something. Every solution adds confidence.
